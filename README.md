# Earthquake Simulator 

Final Project
Course: Differential Equations 1 
May 2019. 

## Description 

This project is a simulator for buildings in an earthquake situation, the goal was to model and observe how buildings deform when the ground moves violently. Although commonly used for video game development, Unity5 was used to create the environment and necessary conditions to observe the previously mentioned phenomena. Python 2.7 was also integrated as the mathematical logic mastermind, in order to obtain the values needed to observe the change of the buildings through time, since differential equations were used. 

## Getting started 

### Requirements

This project needs the previous installation of Unity5 - download [here](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download) -, Python2.7 or 3 - download [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
